Complete Incomplete Methods: Several methods in both database.py and main.py have unfinished implementations. Ensure all conditional branches and exception handlers are properly filled out to prevent runtime errors.

Import Missing Modules: In database.py, modules like logging and sqlite3 are used but not imported. Add the necessary import statements to avoid NameError.

Use Parameterized Queries: Ensure all SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Consistent Exception Handling: Implement uniform exception handling across all methods. Consider creating custom exceptions for better error management.

Optimize Database Connections: Utilize connection pooling or persistent connections to reduce the overhead of establishing connections repeatedly.

Implement Logging Best Practices: Ensure all log messages provide sufficient context. Avoid logging sensitive information and consider different logging levels where appropriate.

Enhance Type Hinting: Improve type annotations for better code clarity and to assist with static type checking.

Refactor Repetitive Code: Identify and extract common code patterns into helper methods to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

Asynchronous Operations: If applicable, make database operations asynchronous to enhance performance, especially in I/O-bound applications.

Validate User Inputs: Implement validation for all user inputs to maintain data integrity and prevent potential errors.

Use Configuration Management: Store configuration settings in a separate configuration file or environment variables, and ensure they are securely managed.

Implement Caching Mechanisms: For frequently accessed data, consider implementing caching to reduce database load and improve response times.

Adopt an ORM: Consider using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like SQLAlchemy to simplify database interactions and enhance code readability.

Ensure Proper Resource Management: Use context managers consistently to manage resources like database connections and file handles, ensuring they are properly closed after use.

Optimize AIProviderFactory: Review the factory pattern implementation to ensure efficient creation and reuse of AI provider instances, possibly leveraging more advanced caching strategies.

Improve Command Handling in TelegramBot: Ensure all commands are fully implemented with appropriate handlers and that edge cases are handled gracefully.

Implement Unit Tests: Create comprehensive unit tests for all critical components to ensure functionality and facilitate future maintenance.

Documentation and Comments: Add clear documentation and comments to explain the purpose and functionality of complex code sections, aiding future developers in understanding the codebase.

Use Environment Variables Securely: Ensure that sensitive information like API keys is securely loaded from environment variables and not hard-coded.

Handle Asynchronous Exceptions: In asynchronous methods, ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled to prevent the application from crashing.

Optimize Imports: Remove unused imports and organize them for better readability and performance.

Adhere to PEP 8 Standards: Ensure the code follows Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 style guide for consistency and readability.

Implement Pagination Efficiently: In methods like list_conversations_command, ensure pagination logic is optimized to handle large datasets without performance degradation.

Enhance Security Practices: Regularly review and update security practices, especially when dealing with user data and external APIs.

Monitor and Profile Performance: Use profiling tools to monitor the application's performance and identify potential bottlenecks for optimization.
